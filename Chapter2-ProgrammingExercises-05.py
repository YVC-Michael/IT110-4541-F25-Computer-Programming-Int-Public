###Distance Traveled

### Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the inter-
### state can be calculated with the following formula:
### Distance 5 Speed 3 Time

## A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
## The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
## The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
## The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

# Named Constants
SPEED = 70

# Print Calculations
hours6 = print(f'In 6 hours the car will travel {SPEED * 6} miles')
hours10 = print(f'In 10 hours the car will travel {SPEED * 10} miles')
hours15 = print(f'In 15 hours the car will travel {SPEED * 15} miles')
