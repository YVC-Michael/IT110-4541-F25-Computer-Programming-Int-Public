## Final Project Option 2: Emil Kissel Park Cookout List Updater

- **Purpose:** Practice list methods along with decision and repetition structures.
- **Scenario:** You and a friend are organizing a cookout at Emil Kissel Park in Yakima. The initial guest list contains nine attendees: Chidi, Lucas, Miriam, Jorge, Gwen, Nneka, Egan, Estella, and Josh.
- **Task:**
  - Create a Python program that stores the guest list and presents a menu to add names, remove names, or quit.
  - When adding guests, prompt for each name, allow multiple additions until the user opts out, display the added names, show the new headcount and list, and write the updated list to file with confirmation messaging.
  - When removing guests, prompt for the name to remove, allow repeated removal actions, display removed names, show the updated headcount and list, and write the new list to file with confirmation messaging.
  - Prepare a presentation for the software-judge panel (see the Presentation section below).
- **Criteria:** Refer to `ProjRubric` and the Presentation Criteria sheet. See the textbook figures for typical output, including:
  - *Figure 1: Typical output from the Emil Kissel Park Cookout List Updater*
  - *Figure 2: Outcome of adding a name*

## Presentation
Create a PowerPoint presentation to showcase your project. Address the following points:

1. Demonstrate the program working.
2. Include flowcharts, pseudocode, and screenshots of program results.
3. Explain how the program benefits the user and other stakeholders.
4. Describe why stakeholders should support implementing the program.
5. Research and incorporate the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Example resource: [The 7 stages of the software development life cycle](https://www.emergentsoftware.net/blog/the-7-stages-of-the-software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/).
6. Discuss software development best practices, such as:
   - <https://geeksprogramming.com/best-practices-for-software-development-projects/>
