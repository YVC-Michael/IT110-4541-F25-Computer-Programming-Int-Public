###7. Driver’s License Exam

### The local driver’s license office has asked you to create an application that grades the writ-
### ten portion of the driver’s license exam. The exam has 20 multiple-choice questions. Here
### Your program should store these correct answers in a list. The program should read the
### student’s answers for each of the 20 questions from a text file and store the answers in
### another list. (Create your own text file to test the application.) After the student’s answers
### have been read from the file, the program should display a message indicating whether the
### student passed or failed the exam. (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions
### to pass the exam.) It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions,
### the total number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question num-
### bers of the incorrectly answered questions.
