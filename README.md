A Little About Me: My name is Peter Udo. I am your instructor for the course. This is my third year here at Yakima College. I joined YVCC in September of 2022. Prior to YVCC, I taught in a number of higher institutions in North Carolina.  One of them is North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, where I served in various capacities such as Professor and Technology Manager. Another is Virginia College, where I served as the Head of Department/Director of Network Engineering Technology. I also had the opportunity to work with various organizations, including Dell Computers (Dell America Operations in the Piedmont Triad of NC) & AT&T.

I hold at least six IT certifications, including Microsoft Windows Administration, Azure  AI Engineering, Cisco Network Administration, Cybersecurity, CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, Linux+. My goal is to ensure that you get the most out of this class.

Included on this page is a copy of your syllabus (See attachment) for the course, as well as 'College Resources' to help you navigate the learning process in the class and the college in general.
